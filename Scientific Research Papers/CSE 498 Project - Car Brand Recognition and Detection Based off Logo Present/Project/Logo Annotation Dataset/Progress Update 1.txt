After getting about 20 images for each car brand, we tried to implemenent a Faster RCNN
model with respect to region proposal. However we ran into errors such as training on more
than a single image and predictions relied entirely on the ground truth given to train on.
Not to mention, the run time and implementatiom time daunted our capabilities and current
time frame. 
However, this issue was mitigated with the implementation of a basic RCNN model with respect
to selective search, which was more than atiquate for the task on hand, with Faster RCNN
being able to detect and recognize within 5 frames. At the time speaking, the HOG
and SGDClassifier has ran into a minor problem, with it not training as well the other day,
while using the exact same data. It is a shame that model was not saved due to forgetfullness.
While the testing data is just the training data, its easy to see that more data will be
needed to train on so that it may classify logo regions better for specific cases such as
BMW. 
Overall, progress has been good..
