//**Joining DataFrames and Selecting Features**
/*Letâ€™s create temporary views for the matchSummaryT and missSummaryT DataFrames, join them on the field column, and compute some simple summary statistics on the resulting rows:*/
matchSummaryT.createOrReplaceTempView("match_desc") //relate matchSummaryT to match_desc
missSummaryT.createOrReplaceTempView("miss_desc")
spark.sql(""" 
	SELECT a.field, a.count + b.count total, a.mean - b.mean delta
	FROM match_desc a INNER JOIN miss_desc b ON a.field = b.field
	WHERE a.field not in ("id_1", "id_2")
	ORDER BY delta DESC, total DESC
	""").show()
/*Okay the first line says, we are choose objects a's field, add a count and b count to a column called total, and one more column called delta to represent the diff in a and b fields mean.
The next line states that match_desc is a, and we are going to join a with miss_desc, which is respectively b on fields where a and b have the field name
HOWEVER, do not need id_1 or id_2 to be added to the resulting table
Order the table by delta desc, with total descinding as well*/
